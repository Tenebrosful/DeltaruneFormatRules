## **Route**
* You must recruit every enemy that is ale to be recruited and have a complete recruit log at the end of the run. *(The completed log does not have to be shown during the run.)*
    - For runner ease, the cutscene before the Giga Queen fight will reflect if you have recruited all the enemies. *(Only the last roller coaster should be empty)*

# **Time Rules**
* Timing starts on selecting "Start" on a new save file. *(The frame the "YES" button switches to a dim yellow)*
* Timing ends after the final line of text closes before Kris enters the bed. *(The frame the text in the textbox disappears)*

# **Save Files**
* Having completion data from both CH1 and CH2 in your game files is permitted for the different title screen as well as the intro cutscene skip, performed by interacting with the bed while having CH1 completion data.

# **Standalone CH1 Release**
* Using fullscreen in conjunction with a monitor with a refresh rate above 60hz, in order to increase game speed, is banned. *(This only applies for runs performed on the original standalone CH1 release.)*

# **Route**
* You must complete the game alongside getting the True Pacifist ending in the Dark World.
